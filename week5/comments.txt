exercise 3 with race:
for some unknown reason
everything is crushing after some amount of time

if you have tried calling from terminal, stdout is not flushed
try using gdb

i was initialy trying to use sleep with producers and consumers
but output didn't get to the point of exchanging data

after removing sleeps, there was exchanging of data in the stdout

after playing with sleeps, amount of exchanging data was varying

if you completly remove the sleeps amount of data was maximum
if you leave some sleeps in the code amount of data become less
if you leave all sleeps nothing is printed
