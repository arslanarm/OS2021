Recovery: Recovery from deadlock means, whenever system get's deadlocked,
    OS should go back to the safe state and make a decision that will avoid the deadlock.
    Recovery is useful when system can rollback to a safe state and killing a process is not the solution.
Prevention: When deadlock occurs, OS should kill some processes to return into the safe state.
    Prevention of the deadlocks is useful when system should not stop by any means and restarting the process is not a big deal.
Avoidence: System should monitor the resources that are occupied by processes and run only in the safe state
    Avoidence is particularly good when you either don't know or you know that running processes must not be killed.
