Hit/Miss ratio gets bigger if there is small amount of programms that are using the swap memory, and programms are always referr to the small number of pages. 
Meaning that pages will be usually in the main memory.
Ratio gets smaller either if there is a relativly large amount of programms are running so they are accessing the different pages and the page table can't feet most of them.
Second way of getting the ratio smaller when programms are using a lot of pages and when they used one they won't try to use it again
